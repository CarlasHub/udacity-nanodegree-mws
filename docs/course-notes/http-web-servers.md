HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the language that web browsers and webservers speak to each other. Every time you open a web page, or download a file,or watch a video like this one, it's HTTP that makes it possible.

In this course, you'll take a look at how all that takes place.

- In lesson one, you'll explore the building blocks of HTTP.
- In lesson two, you'll write web server and client programs from the ground up and handle user input from HTML forms.
- In lesson three, you'll learn about web server hosting, cookies, and many other more practical aspects of building web services.

This course is a bridge. It's going to connect your knowledge of basic web technologies, like HTML, with your experience writing code in Python.

With that foundation, you can go on to learn and build many more awesome things.
